# Credential Storage

There are currently five credential storage options available:

1. ** File Store ** (default) - Stores the credentials in a JSON file on the default disk.
2. ** Cache Store ** - Stores the credentials in the cache.
3. ** Model Store ** - Stores the credentials against a predefined model.
4. ** Authenticated User Store ** - Stores the credentials against the authenticated user.
5. ** Array Store ** - Stores the credentials in an array.

## Changing the default storage

If your using a default storage you can change the `xero.credential_store` config key to point to the new implementation.

## File Store
Credentials are stored in a JSON file using the default disk on the Laravel Filesystem, with visibility set to private. This allows credential sharing across multiple servers using a shared disk such as S3, regardless of which server conducted the OAuth flow.

To use a different disk, change the `xero.credential_disk` config item to another disk defined in `config/filesystem.php`.

## Cache Store

Credentials are stored in the cache, this is useful for applications that do not have a shared disk.

## Model Store

Credentials are stored against a predefined model, this is useful for applications that have a settings model.

For the package to know which model you want to use, you will need to call the following method:

```php
use Webfox\Xero\Xero;
use App\Models\User;

Xero::useModelStore(Settings::first());
```

If you need to resolve a model depending on some application state such as the authenticated user, this should be added to [a custom middleware](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/middleware#defining-middleware) instead of the app service provider, e.g.

<?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Webfox\Xero\Xero;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class ConfigureXeroMiddleware
{
    public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
    {
        if ($request->user()) {
            Xero::useModelStore($request->user()->currentTeam);
        }

        return $next($request);

    }
}

By default, the package will use the `xero_credentials` field, Should you need to rename this field, you can do so by calling:

```php
use Webfox\Xero\Xero;

Xero::useAttributeOnModelStore('my_custom_field');
```

## Authenticated User Store

Credentials are stored against the authenticated user. By default, the package will use the `xero_credentials` field on the Users table. 

Should you need to rename this field, you can do so by calling: 

```php
use Webfox\Xero\Xero;

Xero::useAttributeOnModelStore('my_custom_field');
```

Should you need to change the authentication guard, you can do so by calling:
```php
use Webfox\Xero\Xero;

Xero::setDefaultAuthGuard('admin');
```

## Array Store

Credentials are stored in an array, this is useful for testing purposes only. Once the application is restarted, the credentials will be lost.

## Creating your own Storage Manager

You can create your own storage manager by implementing the `OauthCredentialManager` interface, it is suggested that you extend the `BaseCredentialManager` class.

You will need to implement the following methods:

1. `exists()` - Returns a boolean indicating if the credentials exist.
2. `store(AccessTokenInterface $token, array $tenants = null)` - Creates/Updates the credentials.
3. `data(string $key = null)` - Returns the stored credentials (it is recommended you check the credentials exists, if not throw the `XeroCredentialsNotFound` exception).

Once this has been completed, you should point `xero.credential_store` to your new implementation.
